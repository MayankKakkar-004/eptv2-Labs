# Host Discovery Lab using Nmap

This lab demonstrates how to perform host discovery on a network using **Nmap**. It focuses on identifying live hosts behind a firewall that may not respond to traditional ICMP ping requests.

##  Lab Steps Overview

1. **Ping the Target Host**
   ```bash
   ping -c 5 demo.ine.local
   ```
2. **Run Basic Nmap Scan**

```bash
  nmap demo.ine.local
```
3. **Use `-Pn` Option to Skip Host Discovery**

```bash
nmap -Pn demo.ine.local
```
4. **Scan Specific Port (e.g., 443)**

```bash
nmap -Pn -p 443 demo.ine.local
```
5. **Detect Application Version on Port 80**

```bash
nmap -Pn -sV -p 80 demo.ine.local
```

#  Scan the Server 1

This lab walks through the process of using **Nmap** to scan a target machine for open ports and perform service detection.

---

## Step 1: Access the Kali Machine

- Open the lab link provided by the instructor or lab environment.
- This will give you access to a Kali Linux instance where you can execute all required commands.

---

## ðŸ“¡ Step 2: Check if the Target Machine is Reachable

Use the `ping` command to ensure the target machine is online and reachable:

```bash
ping -c 4 demo.ine.local
```

- The `-c 4` flag sends 4 ICMP packets.
- If the target responds, it's reachable and ready for scanning.

**Result:** The target machine is reachable.

---

##  Step 3: Port Scanning with Nmap

###  Basic Nmap Scan

Run the default Nmap scan to identify commonly open ports:

```bash
nmap demo.ine.local
```

 **Note:**  
The default Nmap scan only checks the top 1000 most commonly used ports.  
In this case, **no open ports were found** using the default scan.

---

###  Full TCP Port Scan

To scan all **65,535 TCP ports**, use the `-p-` flag:

```bash
nmap demo.ine.local -p-
```

 **Result:** The scan reveals that **3 ports** are open on the target system.

---

##  Step 4: Service Detection with Nmap

Once the open ports are identified (e.g., 6421, 41288, 55413), use Nmap to perform **service and version detection**:

```bash
nmap demo.ine.local -p 6421,41288,55413 -sV
```

- The `-sV` flag tells Nmap to detect service versions running on the open ports.

 **Result:** The scan identifies the names and versions of the services running on the open ports.

---

##  Conclusion

In this lab, we successfully:

- Verified the availability of the target machine.
- Used Nmap to perform a **default** and **full TCP port scan**.
- Identified **3 open ports**.
- Used **service detection** to find out which services and versions were running on the open ports.

##  Tools Used

- **Kali Linux**
- **Nmap**

#  Lab: Windows Recon - SMB Nmap Scripts

This lab demonstrates how to use **Nmap SMB scripts** to perform reconnaissance on a Windows machine exposing SMB services.

---

##  Step 1: Access the Kali Machine

- Open the provided lab link to access the Kali Linux environment.

---

##  Step 2: Ping the Target Machine

Check if the target machine is alive:

```bash
ping -c 5 demo.ine.local
```

**Result:** All five packets were successfully sent and received, confirming the machine is up.

---

##  Step 3: Initial Nmap Scan

Run a basic Nmap scan to identify open ports:

```bash
nmap demo.ine.local
```

---

##  Step 4: Identify SMB Protocols

Check which SMB protocols are supported on port 445:

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-protocols demo.ine.local
```

---

##  Step 5: Check SMB Security Mode

Run the script to get SMB security mode details:

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-security-mode demo.ine.local
```

**Result:** Able to retrieve security level of SMB using a guest account.

---

##  Step 6: Enumerate Logged-in Users

### Without Credentials

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-sessions demo.ine.local
```

> Found: user "bob" is logged in (guest login enabled - a misconfiguration)

### With Valid Credentials

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-sessions --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

---

##  Step 7: Enumerate SMB Shares

### Without Credentials

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-shares demo.ine.local
```

**Result:** IPC$ share has read/write access via guest account.

ðŸ“˜ About IPC$: Null session share allowing enumeration.

### With Credentials

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-shares --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

**Result:** Administrator has full access to C$ (C:\ drive)

---

##  Step 8: Enumerate Users on the Target

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-users --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

**Users Discovered:** Administrator, bob, Guest

---

##  Step 9: Get Server Statistics

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-server-stats --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

**Result:** Server stats including failed logins, open files, and system errors.

 Note: Your output may vary depending on system activity.

---

##  Step 10: Enumerate Domains

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-domains --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

 **Result:** Built-in domain identified.

---

##  Step 11: Enumerate User Groups

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-groups --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

---

##  Step 12: Enumerate Services

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-services --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

---

## Step 13: List Files in Shared Folders

```bash
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-shares,smb-ls --script-args smbusername=administrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 demo.ine.local
```

**Result:** All shared folders and their contents were listed.

---

##  Conclusion

In this lab, we used multiple Nmap SMB scripts to:

- Discover SMB versions and security modes
- Enumerate sessions, shares, users, groups, and services
- Check permissions with and without credentials

---

##  Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Nmap with SMB NSE scripts
